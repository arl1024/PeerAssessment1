This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk.

###Loading and preprocessing the data

First set work directory and load data from activity file.

```{r}
setwd("C:/CURSOS/COURSERA/Reproducible Research/PROYECTO/PeerAssessment1")
activity<-read.csv("./data/activity.csv")
```

####What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset with `na.rm=FALSE`.

Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
a<-tapply(activity$steps,activity$date,sum,na.rm=FALSE)
plot(a, col = "red", lwd = 10, ylab='Number of steps', xlab='Day of period')
lines(a)
```

Another plot with `barplot(a)` present bars reflecting how long we go whith steps
```{r,echo=FALSE}
barplot(a)
```

For present the frequency of the walks we can see an histogram
```{r}
hist(a, col="lightgrey", main="Histogram of steps", xlab="Number of steps", ylab="Number of days")
```

####Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

The mean is calculated with:
```{r}
media<-tapply(activity$steps,activity$date,mean,na.rm=FALSE)
```

and plot with `plot(a)`:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(media, col="blue", type="l")
```

The median is calculated with:
```{r}
mediana<-tapply(activity$steps,activity$date,median,na.rm=FALSE)
summary(mediana)
# ops median is 0 !
```

but in `summary(activity)` also the median of steeps is 0
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(activity)
```

If we want the median when steeps is greather than 0 construct a subset and plot it
```{r}
b<-subset(activity,steps>0)
mediana<-tapply(b$steps,b$date,median,na.rm=FALSE)
plot(mediana, col="red", type="l",ylim=c(0,120))
lines(media, col="blue")
```
